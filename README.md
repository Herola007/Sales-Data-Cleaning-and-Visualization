### Project Overview
As a junior data analyst, I collaborated with Raye Stores to clean and restructure a disorganized dataset from their sales department. The goal was to transform the messy data into a structured format suitable for analysis and reporting.

After receiving the dataset, I began the cleaning process in Power Query, following a systematic approach to ensure data accuracy and consistency while establishing a fixed schema for future use.

This repository provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to the data cleaning process, demonstrating how Power Query was used to resolve various data issues. The final cleaned dataset was prepared for analysis and visualization in Power BI to generate actionable insights.


### Data Cleaning/Transformation
The sales team provided the dataset in CSV format, which I initially opened in Microsoft Excel. To streamline the necessary transformations, I imported the dataset into Power Query Editor, where I could fully manage the cleaning and transformation process. While the dataset appeared disorganized at first, Power Query made it much more manageable.

This section outlines the step-by-step process of transforming and cleaning the data. Screenshots are included to illustrate each step, along with explanations of the actions taken and their rationale.

- The image above shows the badly structured data after importing into Power Query

The first image illustrates how data can be transferred from Excel into Power Query. To simplify the analysis process, I returned to Excel and split the dataset into two parts. This division made it easier to manage and clean the data effectively.

- The highlighted section in the image above indicates the portion of the dataset that will be separated from the larger dataset for further processing. The highlighted section is going to get imported back into Power Query.

 - After importing the second part of the dataset back into Power Query, I utilized the Transpose button under the Transform ribbon. This action transposed the table, resulting in the output shown in the image above.

- A new column named Segment was added to the transposed table to categorize the modes of shipment.

 - Next, I proceeded to unpivot the table, excluding the first two columns. The image above illustrates the resulting table after this transformation. After completing the transformation for the second part of the dataset, I then loaded the data back into Excel.

After transforming the highlighted portion of the data shown earlier, I can now return to the original dataset to continue with the cleaning process. This step is crucial to ensure that all inconsistencies and inaccuracies are addressed, allowing for a more reliable analysis.

- The image above displays the original dataset that requires transformation before I can proceed.

- This image displays the result of pivoting the original dataset, excluding the first column. The first 18 rows will be deleted as they are irrelevant to the analysis, especially since we already have their descriptions in the second dataset.

- This is the result of our original dataset after being transformed. Now, I have two datasets in my Excel workbook, but both still contain duplicate values. The next step is to remove these duplicates to ensure the data is fully clean.

- This is my first dataset, transformed using Power Query, with each column properly renamed to reflect the appropriate titles. The dataset is now fully cleaned.

![img_nine](https://github.com/Herola007/Raye-Stores-Sales-Data-Cleaning-and-Visualization/blob/main/Steps/2024-10-09%20(9).png?raw=true)
- This is my second dataset, which has also been transformed using Power Query, with each column appropriately renamed.

To merge the two datasets, I will use a lookup function—either XLOOKUP or the INDEX-MATCH function—to find the appropriate values for each OrderID. For this project, I’ll be using INDEX-MATCH, so let’s dive right into it.

The segment for each Orderid has been successfully retrieved using the formula above. Next, I will use the same approach to find the Ship Mode for each Orderid.

This is the final result of my cleaned and transformed datasets, which will also be uploaded to this repository as a CSV file. I can now proceed to analyze and visualize this dataset using Microsoft Power BI.

## Insights
The dashboard shown above was built using Power BI to visualize key insights from my cleaned dataset. I created several custom measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) within Power BI, allowing me to derive deeper insights, these measures enabled more detailed analysis based on various factors.

**Measures created:**
1. **Total Orders** = COUNT('Raye Store Cleaned Data'[Order_id])
2. **Segments** = DISTINCTCOUNT('Raye Store Cleaned Data'[Segment])
3. **Ship Modes** = DISTINCTCOUNT('Raye Store Cleaned Data'[Ship_Mode])
4. **Total Sales Amount** = SUM('Raye Store Cleaned Data'[Value])
5. **Avg. Sales Amount** = AVERAGE('Raye Store Cleaned Data'[Value])

The dashboard I built for Raye Stores provides a detailed overview of their sales and order performance. It shows that the store processed a total of 822 orders, spread across 3 distinct customer segments and 4 different ship modes. The total sales amount was $392,000, with an average sales value of $476.55 per order.

To analyze sales by segment, I created a column chart, which revealed that the Consumer segment had the highest sales, amounting to $197,000. This was followed by the Corporate segment with $121,000 in total sales. Additionally, a column chart for total orders by segment showed that the Consumer segment also led in order volume, with 456 orders, while the Home Office segment had the fewest, with 124 orders.

I also visualized the sales amount by ship mode. The Standard Class ship mode was the clear leader, accounting for $226,000 in sales, followed by Second Class with $94,000. To further explore customer preferences, I created another column chart showing the total number of orders by ship mode. It revealed that Standard Class was the most preferred, with 482 orders, followed by Second Class with 173 orders.


## Recommendations

1. The Consumer segment is the largest contributor to both sales and order volume, accounting for $197,000 in sales and 456 orders. Given its importance, Raye Stores should consider further segmenting this group to identify specific customer preferences or behaviors. Raye store should also consider personalized marketing campaigns and  exclusive promotions targeted at consumers could help increase engagement and retention.
 
2. The Standard Class ship mode not only generated the highest sales $226,000 but was also the most preferred option with 482 orders. Raye Stores should ensure that this shipping option remains cost-effective, efficient, and reliable, as it is clearly the top choice for customers. Also they could think of offering incentives such as free or discounted shipping for Standard Class on larger orders could further drive sales.

3. The Corporate segment generated $121,000 in sales, there is potential for growth. Raye Stores can consider introducing tailored solutions such as business-to-business offerings or volume discounts to attract more corporate clients. Building relationships with existing corporate customers through dedicated account management or customized service packages could also help boost revenue.

4. The Home Office segment had the lowest number of orders 124 and the lowest contribution to sales. Raye Stores may need to explore why this segment underperforms compared to others. This could involve gathering feedback through customer surveys or analyzing market trends to identify gaps.
